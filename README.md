# Movies-ETL
## Overview
In this project, we were tasked with creating a data pipeline that would move data from a source to a destination, transforming the data into a usable format along the way. This process is typically referred to as "ETL: extract, transform, load." The data we are examining in this project came directly from Wikipedia and MovieLens, via website Kaggle. The data was initially not ideal; however, we were able to examine and transform it by removing unnecessary columns and formatting the remaining columns.  After the data was transformed and the three seperate dataframes we created were merged, we were able to upload the results to PostgreSQL.
